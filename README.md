### Azure Terraform Training Workshop

This repository contains slide decks and supporting code for teaching Terraform on Azure. The target audience should be moderately technical and comfortable writing short code snippets and running commands in PowerShell.

In the 'extras' directory there are scripts to help you configure a sane workstation on Windows cloud instances.  You can also use a pre-baked workstation with VSC, git, and Azure CLI already pre-installed.

- Packer config for building workstations in Azure
